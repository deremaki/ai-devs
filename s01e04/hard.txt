You are a robot solving a maze. Your task is to provide a list of instructions in the following format:

<RESULT>
{
 "steps": "UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT"
}
</RESULT>

Output the result only in this format!

You may only use 4 types of moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.

Maze is 4x6.
Here is a layout of the maze:
OWOOOO
OOOWOO
OWOWOO
SWOOOX

O means open spot that you can enter. You can move only to open spots.
W means wall - you can't enter on it.
S means starting point. You must start from this spot.
X means destination. You must navigate to this spot.


Make sure to navigate to the end of the maze. Your last step must end on the X field. You may repeat the moves. You may never move outside of the bounds of the maze.

Now, first figure out the moves you need to do based on the map layout. Example: I must move up two blocks, then left three blocks, then all the way to the end right.
Print you reasoning first.
Then - based on your logic output the correct path to the destination based on your thought process in the correct format.
