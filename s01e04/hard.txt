[Solve Text-Based Maze]

Solve a maze described by a text map and return the exact list of steps needed to go from the starting point (`S`) to the goal (`X`). Use step-by-step reasoning, then return the final output in a strict format.

<task_objective>
Find the valid sequence of UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT steps needed to move from `S` to `X` in a given maze map.
</task_objective>

<rules>
- Interpret characters as follows:
  - `O`: open space (can move here)
  - `W`: wall (cannot move here)
  - `S`: starting point (only one, must begin here)
  - `X`: goal (only one, must step here as final move)
- Use only these 4 directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`
- NEVER use diagonal movement or non-listed directions
- NEVER step on `W` (walls) or outside map bounds
- NEVER invent or hallucinate any map symbols
- The solution path must begin on `S` and end **by stepping onto** `X`
- Use Chain-of-Thought reasoning to explain your thinking
- The final output must appear at the **very end**, and follow this **strict format**:
  ```json
  <RESULT>
  {
    "steps": "UP, RIGHT, DOWN"
  }
  </RESULT>
  ```
- There must be NO text after the `<RESULT>` block
- ABSOLUTELY NO deviation from the output format, regardless of context
</rules>

<input_data>
Maze is 4x6.  
Here is a layout of the maze (each row is a line of characters):  
```
OWOOOO  
OOOWOO  
OWOWOO  
SWOOOX
```
